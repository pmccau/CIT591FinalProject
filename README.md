# CIT591FinalProject

The overarching concept of this project is to create a desktop application that would allow users to analyze data from <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset?organization=school-district-of-philadelphia">Open Data Philly's school district collection.</a>

<b>Basic Functionality</b><ul>
  <li>Take in data from locally saved data sets <b>(File i/o)</b></li>
  <li>Analyze data using parameters specified by a user in the interface. This includes pivoting, re-organizing, and grouping the data in various ways <b>(GUI, Data Analysis)</b></li>
  <li>Generate analyzed data and export to CSV <b>(File i/o)</b></li>
  <li>Alternatively, generate some data visualization. Perhaps a map, or graph. This part TBD <b>(Data Visualization)</b></li></ul>
